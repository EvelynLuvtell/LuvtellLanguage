<div class= "p3" id="anchor4"><p> Aces, the first, the beginning, primary, oneness, wholeness, unity, a fresh start, a clean slate. 
Counterparts, two sides, two pillars, the high priestess, the portal created between two opposing sides. 
Balance, the scales, justice, equal, egalitarian, level, calm, measured.
  </p>
</div>




<div class = "p3" id="anchor3"> <p> we became something more. as we fell into the ash and grime, we became something more. a fallen angel falling upward out of hell. dark angel goddess of entropy. a witch as a performance but an angel as divine true self.</p>
</div>
<div class = "p3"> <p>  Introduce your energy to the presence in the room, we took too long to address the elephant in the room, I can hear it whining. There&#8217;s a winding road outside of the mountain and the tunnel that goes through it feels like it is tightening closer and closer on top of my skull. Pull confetti out of the top of my spinal cord, pluck my brain stem. I went out on a limb for you, I walked the plank, outside giving thanks for what I have and what I haven&#8217;t. Losing myself in the cavern, the walls drip and ooze onto your finger tips when you stroke the cave paintings. Standing up and almost fainting. Eyes blank and empty. Blink out the dust, the rain is heavy. The rain brings mold and my nose is snotty. Shoddy shelter in the woods like bridge to teribithea. Terrified of the fever, I&#8217;ve given up. Live up to expectations, expect patience, expect maintenance on my torn ligaments. Fiber optic filaments, screwed in the fundament, underneath the covers. Cover up your starvation.  </p>
</div>
<div class = "p3"> <p>  When you whisper to the wind when does it listen and when does it reply? Plywood stuck with nails, nails trimmed down to the red skin, Ativan on the bathroom sink. Leave the fan on when you sleep for the white noise, notice every noise and wake up alert. learned behaviors, learned to savor the fragments of divine. Safe and sound and aligned. Set the leaves on fire in the backyard where we smoked and there was a food truck in the yard over the chain link fence. Too defensive, fend off the predators and the enemies. There&#8217;s no end of this or an end to me is there? Is there air if its more like an absence? Abcess tooth, I miss my youth and my cousin and getting into abandoned houses. How&#8217;s this all sound to you? </p>
</div>
<div class = "p3"> <p> Piece of paper folded up in the envelope I received on my doorstep, God wept. He wept, God wept. He wept. THe ground is wet underneath of my feet, there is a puddle of oil about a yard away from me in a crater in the asphalt. There is a dirty dog stuffed animal next to the wall on the side of the gas station. Sweat bees swarm over the trash can on the other side of the gas station. The trash can is next to the pump for putting air in car tires. Inside the gas station there is a wide variety selection of tobacco blunt wraps, I promptly buy a pack of two. In an hour my lungs will be tainted by weed smoke and for a short period of time I will be a little more distant from my body than usual. I am able to feel spirits around me and in my peripheral vision I can always see them sliding past eachother like a busy public area.  </p>
